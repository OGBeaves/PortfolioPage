This portfolio page is the first full-length project that I was able to complete while working as a Web Development Trainee for the Global Tech Experience. It showcases my abilities to create a responsive, well-designed website which includes: 
- Hero section with centered text and avatar image
- Mission section, including an animated gif image alongside text
- Skills section to showcase the different skills that I was able to use during my time with GTX
- Inspiration section, including a bootstrap carousel with three images accompanied by three captions
- Contact section with links to current social media sites as well as my LinkedIn page

For this project, I utilized HTML 5, CSS, and Bootstrap Framework, and hope to implement JavaScript functionality as time allows.
